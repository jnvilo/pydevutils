# Welcome to pyDevTools

pyDevTools is a module containing tools that I use a lot for development mainly 
in python. Its capabilities are growing. Installing pyDevTools gives you access
to command line utilities that I hope will be usefull for your day to day 
development. 

## Python module development

### make-python-module 

This command creates a python module skeleton for you complete with Makefile 
to build a specific python version, run tests, and upload to pypi. 

### bump-python-module-version 

Running this command at the root of a python module will open the setup.py 
and increment the version. I wrote this to automate the process of building 
a newer version.


## Git and Github

### make-github-repo

Everytime I start a project be it just a bunch of scripts or a full module, I want
to be able to quickly push it to a new github repo. It can get tedious after a 
while to have to open web browser and go create a new github repo. **make-github-repo**
makes this process very easy.
